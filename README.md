## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment: I feel much more confident with my Java programming and debugging skills. What I struggled with was definitely understanding the shunting-yard algorithm. It was helpful to make an outline on paper, and making a corresponding elaborate outline with code comments. Without that, debugging would've been such a pain.

Any questions you still have? Nope!
